          <p>Chooozing Happy is a person centred approach to healing, using a mix of a lifetime of experiences, new skills I have learned and intuitive gifts I have.</p>

          <p>When collated together, healing on a large scale can occur and freedom to move forward without holding on to emotions from past traumas which may be long gone, but haven’t yet been released from your energetic field.</p>
          
          <p>“Let it go” is a phrase bounced around all the time - but experience has shown me that not everyone knows how to “let go”.  In order for us to move on completely, this needs to be done, and I help people understand how to do this during our sessions.</p>
          
          <p>There are many forms of energy healing, and it can become quite a minefield knowing which is suited to you. I know from experience that the lists and choices are endless.</p>
          
          <p>If it doesn’t feel right, then it isn’t - you know what is best for you - and whatever we do in our lives, should feel right for us.</p>
          
          <p>Having been on many courses I found some teachings seemed to be really difficult and simply not suited to me, where as, others I have simply loved. I really don’t believe anything which is meant for us, should be difficult. It should simply flow without needing to be forced.</p>
          
          <p>Based on that and other factors, Choozing Happy simply helps you find your happy place, by embracing what was, what is and what can be.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>


            
            <span class="w3-left-align">
              <p>To make a change you have to be sick and tired of being sick and tired and that’s exactly where I got to.</p>
 
              <p>spent most of my lifetime battling with what I thought was depression - I realised late one night that I was just Choozing to be not happy.
                I reflected over my life and realised that I had never really taken full responsibility of it and instead - had just been washed along with other people’s lives – trying to make them happy.
                That night, I went to bed and decided the next day to Chooze happy and accept everything that had happened to me as if I had chosen it. Because ultimately, by not being fully responsible – I had.
                Every time a negative thought or feeling came to me, I immediately replaced them with positive ones and instead of feeling like a victim; I chose to feel like a victor.
                I embraced all my life experiences and realised they were actually amazing gifts, which had enabled me to not only connect with almost anyone – but I also realised I was a survivor.</p>                 
                 
              <p>That morning I woke up and stayed focussed on my intention – to Chooze Happy. Everything I did that day and every day thereafter was with a real purpose of just being happy.
                Over time, I was able to break old habits and thought patterns, eventually becoming positive without too much effort at all.</p>
                 
                 
              <p>The more I accepted myself and understood who I was without the judgment of anyone else or who they wanted or expected me to be - the more I became me!
                I removed every feeling of inadequacy, of not being enough, of guilt, of too fat, too thin, to short, too everything that others or I had told me I was, throughout my lifetime.
                Having literally nothing left to lose – I decided instead of feeling fear, I would challenge myself to overcome everything, which held me back.</p>
                 
              <p>I learned how to tune into my intuition more and to understand the messages I felt from spirit. Deciphering what at the beginning felt like cryptic messages and learning to trust the feelings I received.</p>
                
              <p>I have been able to sense energy from a very young age - but I had no understanding of it and nobody to share my experiences with, so I just withdrew into a world I felt I didn’t belong.
                Over the last few years I have focussed on learning how best to understand the gifts I have been given and I am now very grateful for them.
                It has been difficult at times “fitting in” when I could feel so much from other people - but the more I understood - the more at peace I became with knowing we are not here to blend in.
                We are all unique individuals who need to shine our perfectly imperfect selves in this lifetime.
                I now filter people in or out accordingly and embrace my individuality, sharing how to do that in order to help others, is a gift in itself.</p>
                
              <p>My journey, which has led me back to me has been tough, but now I am on the other side of pain - I wouldn’t change a thing. I have most certainly grown through, what I have gone through.</p>

            <h2>Choozing Happy</h2>
            <span class="w3-left-align">
              <p>Setting up Choozing Happy took me a while, as I really didn’t know in which area to pitch this new venture I felt drawn to do.</p>
 
              <p>I can see and hear spirit and see and feel blocks of energy within people’s bodies and how they can let go, in order to grow.</p>
                 
              <p>Overtime I realised that I couldn’t identify myself as a medium, or psychic or any one thing specifically – as what comes to me whilst I am with people is what they need for their highest good - at that time and not necessarily what they may want.
              We can be exceptionally good at burying our heads in the sand, to avoid dealing with specific traumas or emotions.
              This will however impact our lives, now matter how much we try to deny them, or ignore them.</p>
                
              <p>The energy flows best with people who are stuck at some point in their lives – whether that be a change in career is needed, a house move, letting go of guilt or trauma which is weighing down on them, relationship issues – whatever it maybe which seems to have them feeling stuck – is what will come through during the session.
              
              <p>Ahead of a session I feel the persons energy and I begin to act and feel as they would – this is really helpful for me to feel this – as it puts me walking in their shoes and this helps the client feel understood and comfortable quite quickly.</p>
                 
              <p>I will sit with the energy and write down anything which comes to me – (usually around two pages of A4 paper) and within the pages will be exactly what the individual needs to face, in order to let go and move on.</p>
                 
              <p>During sessions I can help people with how to let go of a trauma or issue which is difficult to face and usually quite deeply buried. Anything we carry around hiding from - grows bigger, anything we face disappears.</p>
                 
              <p>I have always loved people and naturally felt drawn to helping anyone I can. I do not judge and instead have a natural understanding of why someone may be responding or reacting the way they are.</p>
                 
              <p>My life is lived being aware that there are no wrongs and no rights – there are just isms.</p>

              <p>It is so freeing to know that and relieves us of so much guilt we can attach to others or ourselves.</p>

            <h2>Sessions</h2>
            <span class="w3-left-align">
              <p>Sessions last between 60&#8211;90 minutes and take place either in the comfort of my home, or via video link.</p>

              <p>Before tuning into any ones energy, I clear the space and ask that only that which is for the highest and greatest good shall be received.</p>
              
              <p>I ask to be clearly shown how I can help and then write down exactly what I am feeling.</p>
              
              <p>During a session I am able to feel the clients aura and where energy blocks are held within their body.</p>
              
              <p>We then work together releasing the trapped emotions and clearing any unwanted energies, which may be holding the client back from moving forward in some area of their life.
               
              As we are talking I constantly receive more guidance and as the aura is being cleared of any old energy, I am able to see new opportunities arising for them.
               
              Our aura is simply like a bag – only so much can fit in it – so in order to receive anything new, we must clear out the old.
              If we were shopping and we saw something we really wanted, but couldn’t fit it in our bag – we would go through the bag and see what we no longer needed to make space for something new.</p>
              
              <p>Our energy field is just the same. We must keep letting go of what is no longer good for us.
              Guilt, blame, shame, fear – take up a lot of space in our bags and the easiest way to empty it, is to accept it and then let it go.
               
              The sessions are very gentle as it is important clients feel safe and trust, in order to receive the most benefit from it.</p>
